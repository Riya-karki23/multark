    Privacy Policy – Ordnungskraft IT Advisory Private Limited
  </h2>

  <p className="mb-4">
    The Internet is an amazing tool. It has the power to change the way we live, and we're starting to see that potential today. With only a few mouse-clicks, you can follow the news, look up facts, buy goods and services, and communicate with others from around the world.
  </p>

  <p className="mb-4">
    It's important to Ordnungskraft IT Advisory Private Limited to help our customers retain their privacy when they take advantage of all the Internet has to offer.
  </p>

  <p className="mb-4">
    We believe your business is no one else's. Your privacy is important to you… and to us. So we'll protect the information you share with us.
  </p>

  <p className="mb-4">
    To protect your privacy, Ordnungskraft IT Advisory Private Limited follows different principles in accordance with world-wide practices for customer privacy and data protection:
  </p>

  <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-6">
    <li>We won’t sell or give away your name, mail address, phone number, email address, credit card number, or any other information to anyone.</li>
    <li>We’ll use state-of-the-art security measures to protect your information from unauthorized users.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">NOTICE</h3>
  <p className="mb-4">
    We will ask you when we need information that personally identifies you (personal information) or allows us to contact you. This typically happens when:
  </p>

  <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
    <li>You create a Registration ID on the site</li>
    <li>You download free software</li>
    <li>You enter a contest</li>
    <li>You order e-mail newsletters</li>
    <li>You join a limited-access premium site</li>
  </ul>

  <p className="mb-4">We use your personal information for the following purposes:</p>

  <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-6">
    <li>To make the site easier for you to use by not having to enter information more than once.</li>
    <li>To help you quickly find software, services, or information.</li>
    <li>To help us create content most relevant to you.</li>
    <li>To alert you to product upgrades, special offers, updated information, and new services.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">CONSENT</h3>
  <p className="mb-4">
    If you choose not to register or provide personal information, you can still use most of <a href="https://erp.multark.com/" className="text-blue-600 underline">https://erp.multark.com</a>. But you will not be able to access areas that require registration.
  </p>

  <p className="mb-4">
    When registering, you can choose the types of information you want to receive from us (e.g., newsletters).
  </p>

  <p className="mb-4">
    If you do not want us to contact you with promotional information via email, phone, or mail, you can opt out. We also sometimes allow third-party companies to offer you products/services by postal mail only — and you can opt out of that too.
  </p>

  <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">ACCESS</h3>
  <p className="mb-4">You can always ensure your personal information is correct and up to date. At the Visitor Center, you can:</p>

  <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-6">
    <li>View and edit personal information you’ve already provided.</li>
    <li>Choose whether to receive marketing messages from us.</li>
    <li>Decide whether third parties may contact you with offers.</li>
  </ul>
